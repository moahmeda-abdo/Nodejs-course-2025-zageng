You are creating a system to manage student grades. Follow the steps below:

1- Create an Array of Student Objects
Each student should have the following properties:

name (string)
grades (array of numbers, e.g., [80, 90, 100])


2- Write a Function to Calculate the Average Grade
Create a function calculateAverage(grades) that takes an array of grades and returns the average grade.

3- Filter Passed Students
A student passes if their average grade is 70 or above.

4- Sort Students by Average Grade (Descending)

5- Print Results



Expected Output :

Mohamed: Average = 90, Passed = true
Ali: Average = 65, Passed = false
Salah: Average = 93.33, Passed = true

Passed Students: ["Mohamed", "Salah"]



hint : The array of objects will be : 

const students = [
    { name: "Mohamed", grades: [80, 90, 100], passed: false },
    { name: "Ali", grades: [60, 70, 65], passed: false },
    { name: "Salah", grades: [85, 95, 100], passed: false },
  ];
